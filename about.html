                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Our journey began at the University of Washington Bothell, where the four of us met in CSS 481. 
                   Each of us came into the class with different backgrounds and skills, but we all shared the same curiosity about building things on the web. 
                <br><br>
                   During the first few weeks of class we decided to team up and create something that challenged us to learn more about web development. 
                   That decision led to the start of our collaborative project — a web app built around creativity, data, and visualization.</p>

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>Our mission is to make data visualization engaging, meaningful, and fun. 
                    With our upcoming 3D web app, we aim to bring the Reddit Place dataset to life in a way that reveals patterns of collaboration and creativity across a massive digital canvas.
                <br><br>
                    We plan to stack pixels to represent frequency, transforming dense numerical data into mountain-like peaks that will show where activity soars and communities form. 
                    To enhance the visual experience, we'll incorporate heat zones to highlight the most vibrant regions of the map — areas where users work together (or clash) to leave their mark.
                <br><br>
                    Ultimately, our goal is to create a visualization that not only looks stunning but also invites people to explore the story behind the data — 
                    the collective effort, conflict, and creativity that turned a blank digital board into a living piece of internet history.</p>
